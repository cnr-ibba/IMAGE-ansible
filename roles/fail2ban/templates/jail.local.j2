# Jail for more extended banning of persistent abusers
# !!! WARNINGS !!!
# 1. Make sure that your loglevel specified in fail2ban.conf/.local
#    is not at DEBUG level -- which might then cause fail2ban to fall into
#    an infinite loop constantly feeding itself with non-informative lines
# 2. If you increase bantime, you must increase value of dbpurgeage
#    to maintain entries for failed logins for sufficient amount of time.
#    The default is defined in fail2ban.conf and you can override it in fail2ban.local
